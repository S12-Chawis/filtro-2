          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>
            I am a <strong>passionate</strong> software development learner with
            a strong background in logic. I enjoy discovering new things every
            day and consider myself <strong>curious</strong>, always able to
            find value in what others might see as <em>boring</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love mathematics and rarely settle for just surface-level
            understanding. I constantly seek deeper knowledge, especially when
            it is aligned with my goals.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am a <strong>charismatic</strong> individual with strong values. I
            enjoy leadership roles but also value spending time alone for
            reflection and growth.
          </p>

          <h2>Meet Santiago Villa Panesso</h2>

          <p>
            I graduated from the software development program at
            <strong>CESDE</strong>, and I am currently pursuing a degree in
            software development technology at the Instituto Tecnológico
            Metropolitano (<strong>ITM</strong>).
          </p>

          <p>
            I worked for over a year and three months in a
            <strong>bilingual call center</strong>, mainly handling emails. This
            helped me improve my <strong>professional writing</strong> and
            <strong>reading comprehension</strong> skills. Later, I worked in
            another call center for three months where I practiced
            <strong>listening</strong> and <strong>speaking</strong> skills in
            English, which helped me gain more fluency and confidence.
          </p>

          <p>
            Currently, I work on weekends as an
            <strong>English teacher</strong> for two groups—one of children and
            one of teenagers. Teaching has not only strengthened my
            communication skills, but also allowed me to reinforce my English
            fluency through real interactions.
          </p>

          <p>
            Outside of tech and education, I am an
            <strong>empirical musician</strong>. I have played the snare drum,
            saxophone, and tuba. I have taken leadership roles in music events
            and taught music theory and instruments to new members of my band,
            which has developed my sense of discipline, creativity, and
            teamwork.
          </p>

          <p>
            When it comes to personal growth, I am deeply
            <strong>ambitious</strong>—my goals are my dreams. I wake up every
            day with a clear vision of what I want to achieve and go to bed
            knowing that I have done my best to get closer to that vision, even
            if I make mistakes along the way.
          </p>

          <p>
            I maintain strong <strong>mental and physical health</strong> habits
            because I believe my body and mind are the engine that drives my
            success. I work hard to keep them in balance so I can give my best
            in every area of life.
